# `Video` Integrating with FlexPay for Payment Recovery

???+ example "Meta"

    This is a video tutorial I wrote, narrated, designed the assets for, and edited. During my time at DirectScale,  I personally created at least 30 of these videos using OBS, Adobe Premiere, Adobe Audition, and Adobe Illustrator. I believe in catering to multiple forms of learning and, for DirectScale clients, watching videos was a more enjoyable experience for them to quickly gain knowledge about a feature. I received tons of feedback from all levels of the company and clients alike for how awesome it was to have a robust video library to use.
