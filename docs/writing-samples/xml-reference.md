This reference details the various Range Types used in a Commission Plan Template. 

At the beginning of a Commission Plan, you must always have a `<ComPeriod>` with the template's details. 
Within that, you have a single `<VolumeRange>` that serves as the Commission Plan's default date range. 

Use Volume Ranges to set separate date ranges to count volume. Each Volume Range has a `Name` attribute, set as anything you want. 

You can reference the name throughout the Commission Plan. The core part of the Volume Ranges is the `<RangeType>`.

Range Types are a period for which you are calculating commissions. The most common Range Types are `<Monthly>`,  `<Weekly>`, and  `<BiMonthly>`.

## `<Monthly>`

A Range starting on the first of the month and ending on the last. Use the `Offset` parameters to include multiple months. Typically, you only use this for a sub-Volume Range, not your main.

| Attribute      | Description                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `StartOffset`       | Takes the main Volume Range and offsets the start date to the past by the amount entered. For example, if the current month is January and you declare `StartOffset=1`, then the `<Monthly>` range starts on December 1st.  |
| `EndOffset`       | Takes the main Volume Range and offsets the start date to the future by the amount entered. For example, if the current month is January and you declare `EndOffset=1`, then the `<Monthly>` range ends on February 28th. |

### Example

The following example looks at the current and previous months.

=== "XML"

    ```xml
    <VolumeRange Name="FirstFullMonth">
        <RangeType>
            <Monthly StartOffset="1" EndOffset="0" />
        </RangeType>
    </VolumeRange>
    ```

## `<Weekly>`

A range of a week (7 days), beginning on the day you define as the `WeekBegin`.

| Attribute | Description |
|---------------|--------------|
| `WeekBegin`  | Assign the day of the week the range begins on (`Monday`, `Tuesday`, `Wednesday`, and so on).

### Example

With the following example, the Volume Range starts on `Monday`.

=== "XML"

    ```xml
    <VolumeRange Name="currentWeek">
        <RangeType>
            <Weekly WeekBegin="Monday" />
        </RangeType>
    </VolumeRange>
    ```

## `<BiMonthly>`

This splits the month in half so that there are two ranges.

| Attribute | Description |
|---------------|--------------|
| `SplitDay`  | The day of the month the split occurs on.

### Example

With the following example,  `SplitDay` of `15` is declared. This results in the first half of the month running the 1stâ€“14th, and the second half starting on the 15th and running the rest of the month. This gives you two ranges in which you could pay commissions.

=== "XML"

    ```xml
    <VolumeRange Name="splitMonth">
        <RangeType>
            <BiMonthly SplitDay="15" />
        </RangeType>
    </VolumeRange>
    ```
