Validus' **Order Book Replay** gives you the ability to watch the market action of an account by playing back a previous trading session using an interactive timeline. You can see how an account's activity relates to market depth and midmarket price. 

**Order Book Replay** lets you see market depth, along with certain alerts to determine if the market is being manipulated.

* Step through filtered internal activity
* Choose from three chart modes (Depth Discrete, Depth Cumulative, and Depth Data)
* Utilize conditional filters to narrow down to the most important information

    Before **Order Book Replay** is officially released, we are making some additional updates to the existing **Time + Sales Viewer** to lay the groundwork. 
    
    With Phase One, the **Time + Sales Viewer** is getting a visual upgrade as shown in the following image. Additionally, an improved filtering menu is being added that you can access by clicking ![Filter](../assets/images/filter.png).

## Features

### Player

![OBR Player](../assets/images/obr-player.png)

Using the Player, you can play or pause the Order Book Replay. The Player displays the time based on your filter selection. 

By scrubbing the timeline with your mouse, you can adjust your location in the replay. The fast forward and fast backward buttons step you to the next filtered account(s) activity and pauses the player at that time. 

### Depth Charts

**Depth Discrete**: Shows the market size across any given order book price

![Depth Discrete](../assets/images/obr-discrete.png)

**Depth Data**: A table that lists out the exact figures of size at each price
