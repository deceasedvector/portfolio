# :wave_tone1: Hi there!

## I'm Jared Peeler, Technical Writer

For over five years, I've built documentation experiences for users and developers alike. 

With a background in **web development**, **graphic design**, and a life-long love of **writing**, I've  developed into a **full-stack Techncial Writer** that can handle any project you throw at me. 

I've created knowledges bases using **Zendesk**, **Readme**, **Confluence**, and **SharePoint**. I'm proficient in **HTML**, **CSS**, **Markdown**, and **AsciiDoc**. I've been developing my knowledge of **JavaScript**, **Python**, **C#**, and Docs-As-Code workflows. I've collected a lot skills over the years, and I'm looking for the opportunity to stretch my what I've learned and take on new challeges!
