## DirectScale Help

DirectScale Help is a knowledge base and help center aimed at DirectScale's userbase. It featured over 600 docs covering every feature in the system. The docs included getting started guides, how-tos, and conceptual overviews--many of which had embedded tutorial videos (over 100 were created)--all of which was written by myself.

I built the knowledge base in Zendesk using a Lotus Themes template I heavily customized.

The result of this site was an end-to-end solution for new customers to get familiar with the system and for existing clients to self-serve answers to their questoins. When that didn't work, the Customer Support team was there to link the articles or snippets of articles in the support cases.

Before Zendesk, we used Intercom. After having to move content from Intercom to Zendesk, I decided to think ahead a little for the day that we may leave Zendesk behind for another doc site option. I didn't want our content locked down in Zendesk's ecosystem with no great way of exporting/importing later. 

I then took inspiration from the Docs-as-code workflow and decided to create my own hybrid that worked for me and my skillset at the time. I authored the content in Markdown in Visual Studio Code, storing the source code in Azure Repos. When ready to publish, I used the Pandoc extension in to convert the Markdown to clean HTML that I manually pasted into the editor of a new Zendesk article. 

For what the workflow lacked in elegance it made up in simplicity and I was able to get it working quickly, not getting bogged-down developing a more programmatic approach with Zendesk's API--although that was the plan for later, but alas, I left the role before doing so.

## DirectScale Developers

DirectScale had a developer problem. Their clients would hire third-party developers to customize their instance and commission plan template (DirectScale had clients in the Multi-level Marketing industry and commission plans are essential and endlessly complex).

The problem was these third-party developers knew nothing of DirectScale's system. The clients were obviously no help in that regard and on the DirectScale side, only a handful of Subject Matter Experts to lend their limited time to help each of these developers individually. There simply wasn't enough expert bandwidith to spread around.

The solution was DirectScale Developers. This is a developer-facing doc site I created using Readme.io. The first version of which featured overviews, definitions, code examples, and reference documentation for the DirectScale API and Client Extension. 

I created a lot of the content by looking through client custom code and pulling examples to demonstrate, breaking those examples down with my own knowledge of DirectScale's code and leaning on the Subject Matter Experts when necessary.
