# Isaac PD Pressure Decay Leak Tester: A User's Guide

???+ example "Meta"

    * **Tool**: Adobe InDesign
    * **About this sample**: For my first Technical Writing internship, I was tasked with creating a new user guide for Zaxis' next product launch. The engineers were writing the documentation previously and they were a bit too complex and wordy. 
  
        My goal was to create a document that was easier to follow for those not as well versed in how the device was supposed to work. Additionally, I wanted to give it a some more visual flare, matching the company's new branding. The result is this PDF that I designed and created in Adobe inDesign.
