# :wave_tone1: Hi there!

## I'm Jared Peeler, Technical Writer

For over five years, I've built documentation experiences for users and developers alike. 

With a background in web development, graphic design, and a life-long love of writing, I've  developed into a full-stack Technical Writer that can handle any project you throw at me. 

I've collected a lot of skills over the years, and I'm looking for the opportunity to stretch what I've learned and take on new challenges!

Look around at my writing samples and résumé. If you like what you see, let's connect!
