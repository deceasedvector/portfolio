# :wave: Hi there!

## I'm Jared Peeler, Technical Writer

For over five years I've built documentation experiences for users and developers alike. With a background in **web development**, **graphic design**, and a life-long love of **writing**, I've  developed into a **full-stack Techncial Writer** that can handle any project you throw at me. 

I've created knowledges bases using **Zendesk**, **Readme**, **Confluence**, and **SharePoint**. I'm proficient in **HTML**, **CSS**, **Markdown**, and **AsciiDoc**, and I have developing knowledge of **JavaScript**, **Python**, **C#**, and Docs-As-Code workflows (like this portfolio uses!).

Take a look around at my writing samples and resume. If you like what you see, let's chat!
