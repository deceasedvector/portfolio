I reached out to the program and outreach coordinator, we sat down for an hour, and she answered my questions. After that I prepared a draft, which was peer reviewed by my classmates, and I sent it off to the High Country Times head editor who gave me notes. I then wrote a final draft and sent it to my inverviewee to approve.</p> <p>The following article is the result, which is currently published on the High Country Times website. It was my first and last forray into news article writing. I had to quickly learn the basics of AP style, but all-in-all, it was a great experience!</p> <p></p> <p>In a small office nestled across from the Watauga Medical Center, the Children\u2019s Council of Watauga County sits unassumingly. Inside the office is a cozy reading area filled with children\u2019s and parenting books, as well as people working tirelessly to make a bigger impact in the community than the modest office might let on.</p> <p>One of these people is Mary Scott, program and outreach coordinator. She knows firsthand why the work of the Children\u2019s Council is important and wants you to know what you could be doing to better your community.</p> <p>Celebrating its 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary this year, the Children\u2019s Council has been helping make Watauga County a community that fosters early child development and prepares new parents for the stresses of parenthood in many ways.  </p> <p>\u201cChildren are our future.\u201d That may be a cheesy sentiment from a Whitney Houston song, but it is true nonetheless, and the Children\u2019s Council was founded with a fervent devotion to giving children the future they deserve. Focusing specifically on Watauga County, its cornerstones are early childhood development and family support. Its family support wing offers families in need resources that make raising a child a little easier.</p> <p></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard becoming a parent \u2014 trying to figure out how to handle a new baby and all the issues that entail. It\u2019s exciting. It\u2019s a wonderful time, but it\u2019s challenging trying to figure out,\u201d Scott said.</p> <p>Scott said there is so much to learn about the health, safety, and development of children that raising them can be a difficult time in life for the average parent.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of families that come here that need additional resources and have questions about what\u2019s normal and what\u2019s not normal. So, we try to connect them with our services and others in the community as needed,\u201d Scott said.  </p> <p>The Children\u2019s Council also serves as a hub for the Who Needs a Change? Diaper Bank, through which families can receive a free pack of diapers every month. While they\u2019re in the office to pick up diapers, they can also learn about some of the other programs that are offered.</p> <p>\u201cWe offer Triple P parenting support and The Incredible Years, which are parenting support programs,\u201d Scott said. \u201cA lot of it is just having a sounding board to talk through different issues they are going through with their children and with other parents who are going through the same thing.\u201d</p> <p>One of the oldest nonprofits in the area, the Children\u2019s Council was started in 1977 as a grassroots effort focusing mainly on childcare centers. It was not long until it became the county\u2019s official Smart Start agency, which directly funds Quality Support Programs and child care centers.</p> <p>\u201cWe have been growing since 1977 and now have a family support focus, as well. We saw the need to expand \u2014 to offer more services that would benefit children,\u201d Scott said.</p> <p>One of the areas of expansion comes in the form of \u201cNurtured Beginnings,\u201d a new program started this year that specifically helps families with newborns up to 12 weeks old. It enables a postpartum specialist to visit the family up to three times in their home for free and bring a meal from Green Street Catering or F.A.R.M. Cafe, as well as a hand-knitted hat for the baby. They also speak with the new parents about the child\u2019s development and screen the parents to identify and help avoid any kind of postnatal anxiety or depression.</p> <p></p> <p>The Children\u2019s Council also does a lot for local teachers, especially teachers involved with early education who need certain training to operate and teach in a childcare center.</p> <p>\u201cWe offer professional development to help teachers set goals and to move the needle to get them where they need to be,\u201d Scott said.</p> <p>The Children\u2019s Council currently has six full-time staff members and 6 part-time staff members who work hard to support local children in their development years. However, it relies on many volunteers who are willing to help in any way they can and it offers several avenues where one can help, including internships for university students.</p> <p>Volunteers are invaluable to this agency, and \u2014 to make it easier to connect with the organization \u2014 a website is in the works that will break down different projects people can take on.</p> <p>So, if you want to help, what kind of services can you volunteer? For one: the knitted caps for the babies. Groups of people may choose to get together and work on knitting caps for the children or providing some of the many other needs.</p> <p>\u201cWe have needs for the childcare centers. We\u2019re working on a project where people can build a water or sand table for childcare centers. We would provide the plans and they could build them on their own if they want to,\u201d Scott said.</p> <p>The Children\u2019s Council also leads community-wide diaper drives. In the past, Appalachian State University student groups, as well as local churches, have participated. In 2014, Boone local Sam Walker used the crowdfunding website GoFundMe to raise over $500 to buy diapers. All the diapers for the diaper bank come from volunteers pulling them together and donating them. Last year, more than 60,000 diapers were given out to families in need.</p> <p></p> <p>The Children\u2019s Council serves its community, but it also needs a lot of support from the community. This mutually beneficial relationship is made evident every year with the organization\u2019s annual Party with a Purpose event.</p> <p>\u201cWe are looking for business donor partners, and we would definitely like to see more community support. Investing in the organization, which in turn is investing in the children during the most important time developmentally in a person\u2019s life, is critical,\u201d Scott said.</p> <p>The help from local businesses and community members directly goes to offer programs for families and children in the area and allows the agency to add new programs as necessary.</p> <p>\u201cWe like to keep a pulse on what the needs are and adjust our programs accordingly,\u201d Scott said.</p> <p>An example of a new program that was started by \u201ckeeping a pulse\u201d on the community needs is D.U.A.L. School, a preschool that is half Spanish speaking children and half English speaking children. The teacher speaks both languages, allowing the children to learn from one another.</p> <p>Another program of note is the Dolly Parton Imagination Library, which gives children up to the age of 5 free access to one book every month.</p> <p>\u201cSo, they can build a whole library in their home. That\u2019s all from community support to cover the cost of these books,\u201d Scott said.</p> <p>\u201cThis time in a child\u2019s life is so important in terms of brain development and forming connections,\u201d Scott said. \u201cWe want to help parents to know how to interact with their children and to understand what they are going through developmentally. It is so important that children have a good, healthy home life and that preschool is a good quality experience.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p>For more information about the Children\u2019s Council of Watauga County, visit its website.</p> <p>More information about The Children\u2019s Council and upcoming programs you can support:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The Week of the Young Child (April 22-29):</p> <ul> <li>Monday, April 24 \u2013 Open House at The Children\u2019s Council 1 - 4 p.m.</li> <li>Tuesday, April 25 \u2013 Preschool Teacher Appreciation Day.</li> <li>Wednesday, April 26 \u2013 Breakfast of Champions 7:45 - 8:45 a.m.  RSVP required.</li> <li>Thursday, April 27 \u2013 The Playhouse will be offering free admission today if you bring in a pack of diapers for the Children\u2019s Council Diaper Bank.
